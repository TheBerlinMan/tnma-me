          &quot;TNMA&quot; is my Russian name rendered in English letters.
          I&apos;m a first-generation American-Soviet-Jew, and my experiences in
          this world have been primarily shaped by the hybrid nature of my
          identityâ€”making the moniker a nice summary of who I am. But, you can
          just call me Tommy.

          Professionally, I&apos;m a software developer with a background in mathematics. 
          Casually, I&apos;m an artist and designer with a chess addiction. 
          Above all, though, I just consider myself a generalist with a
          passion for design, logical systems, and the human experience.
