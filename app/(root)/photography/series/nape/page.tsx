        The Nape is an ongoing series of photographs dedicated to documenting
        the subtleties of the true self in public spaces. When a person knows
        that their portrait is being taken, a wall is subconsciously erected
        which hides the persons honest self. A persons true self is on display
        only within the moments when they forget that they are being observed.
